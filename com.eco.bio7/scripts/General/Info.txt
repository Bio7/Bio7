The scripts menu display, interprets, compiles and executes all scripts which are found in the scripts location.

Folders and nested folders with scripts can be created which will be dynamically added to
the scripts menu (in the main 'Scripts' menu folders are displayed if a file can be found in the folder!).

The base location of the scripts can be changed in the preferences.

Files which start with a point '.' or with underscore '_' are not displayed (see Java info below).

Java specific:

If you name dependent Java classes or helpfiles with an underscore '_'
they can be referenced and compiled from the main class (hiding the dependent
classes or *.fxml files with an underscore for a clean menu).
