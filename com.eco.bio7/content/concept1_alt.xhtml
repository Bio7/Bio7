<font size="-1">The application Bio7 is an integrated
development environment for ecological modelling with a main focus on
individual based modelling and spatially explicit models. The
application itself is based on an RCP-Eclipse-Environment
(<b>R</b>ich-<b>C</b>lient-<b>P</b>latform) which offers a huge
flexibility in configuration and extensibility because of its plug-in
structure and the possibility of customization.<br />
<br />
In this platform powerful known tools
were integrated for the purpose of simulations and analysis of
ecological systems.<br />
A lot of complexity of a modelling
process is hidden behind a user-friendly flexible <b>G</b>raphical
<b>U</b>ser <b>I</b>nterface which should assist the development and
analysis of simulation models for different ecosystems.<br />
Therefore  Bio7 offers and embeds also
powerful and well proofed third party tools which are capable to do
Image Analysis (ImageJ), Statistical Analysis (R), an easy to learn
scripting language (BeanShell) to ease the development of simulation
models and an embedded  Compiler (Janino) for the need of speed in complex
calculations.<br />
Additionally editors (Java, R,
BeanShell) and different panels for visualization are integrated for
an easier development. Communication in between the different
components is possible  by means of scripts and compiled code and can
be collected in a flowchart for Sensitivity-Analysis etc.<br />
<br />
Furthermore an advantage of this
platform is the plug-in structure which can be extended with all kind
of third-party plug ins to support theoretical hypothesis on
ecosystems functioning and the understanding of complex systems.
